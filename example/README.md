# s_dropdown Example


This is a simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to use the `SDropdown` widget from the `s_dropdown` package. The example shows:

- Basic usage and selection
- Custom styled dropdowns with `SDropdownDecoration`
- Excluding the selected item from the overlay
- Using `customItemsNamesDisplayed` for friendlier item text
- Item-specific styles
- Responsive sizes with `sizer` (the app uses `Sizer` for percentage-based widths/heights)
- Controller-based programmatic actions (open/close/highlight/select)

The app lives in `example/lib/main.dart` and is intended to mirror README examples.

To run this example locally:

```bash
cd example
flutter run
```
